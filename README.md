# üõ∞Ô∏è Urban Heat Island (UHI) & Geospatial Analysis
The **Urban Heat Island (UHI) & Geospatial Analysis** project focuses on analyzing satellite imagery and weather data to study urban heat patterns. The notebook utilizes geospatial datasets, machine learning, and remote sensing techniques to assess the impact of land cover and building density on temperature variations.

### ‚ú® Features
- **Geospatial Data Processing**: Reads and processes building footprints (`.kml`), weather data (`.xlsx`), and thermal imagery.
- **Urban Heat Island (UHI) Index Computation**: Analyzes temperature variations using satellite-based Land Surface Temperature (LST).
- **Building Footprint Analysis**: Extracts spatial features from `.kml` data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains predictive models using `Training_data_uhi_index.csv` and generates benchmark results.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Incorporates meteorological observations (`NY_Mesonet_Weather.xlsx`) to enhance analysis.
- **Submission Template**: Provides `Submission_template.csv` for structured model predictions.
